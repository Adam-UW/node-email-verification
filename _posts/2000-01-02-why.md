#### Basically

## This npm module is awesome

Are you making a *MEAN* stack app and need double opt-in user signups? Use ```node-email-verification``` and add user email verification to your MEAN app in minutes!

The way this works is as follows:

- temporary user is created with a randomly generated URL assigned to it and then saved to a MongoDB collection
- email is sent to the email address the user signed up with
- when the URL is accessed, the user's data is transferred to the real collection

A temporary user document has a TTL of 24 hours by default, but this (as well as many other things) can be configured. See the options section for more details. It is also possible to resend the verification email if needed.
