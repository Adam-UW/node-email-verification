**First make sure you have NodeJS and MongoDB installed.**

Then install express.

```

```

Then install email-verification

```
npm install email-verification
```

Then set your options. Make sure that you have a

```javascript
mongoose = require('mongoose');
nev = require('email-verification')(mongoose);
nev.configure({
    verificationURL: 'http://example.com/email-verification/${URL}',
    URLLength: 48,

    // mongo-stuff
    persistentUserModel: null,
    tempUserModel: null,
    tempUserCollection: 'temporary_users',
    emailFieldName: 'email',
    passwordFieldName: 'password',
    URLFieldName: 'GENERATED_VERIFYING_URL',
    expirationTime: 86400,

    // emailing options
    transportOptions: {
        service: 'Gmail',
        auth: {
            user: 'user@gmail.com',
            pass: 'password'
        }
    },
    verifyMailOptions: {
        from: 'Do Not Reply <user@gmail.com>',
        subject: 'Confirm your account',
        html: '<p>Please verify your account by clicking <a href="${URL}">this link</a>. If you are unable to do so, copy and ' +
                'paste the following link into your browser:</p><p>${URL}</p>',
        text: 'Please verify your account by clicking the following link, or by copying and pasting it into your browser: ${URL}'
    },
    shouldSendConfirmation: true,
    confirmMailOptions: {
        from: 'Do Not Reply <user@gmail.com>',
        subject: 'Successfully verified!',
        html: '<p>Your account has been successfully verified.</p>',
        text: 'Your account has been successfully verified.'
    },

    hashingFunction: null,
});
```

Then setup node-mailer with your specified email provider

```
var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({
    from: 'replyemail@example.com',
    options: {
        host: 'smtp.example.com',
        port: 587,
        auth: {
            user: 'your_smtp_username',
            pass: 'your_smtp_email'
        }
    }
);
```

After this you should be now ready to start using node-email-verification!
